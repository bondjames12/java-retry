<p>This package contains the core retry framework classes; this page
    provides descriptions for the core classes, the key concepts, etc.</p>

<p>There are four primary components to the retry framework:</p>

<ul>
    <li>detectors</li>
    <li>strategies</li>
    <li>policies</li>
    <li>listeners</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transient Exception Detectors</h3>

<p>Detectors distinguish transient exceptions from non-transient exceptions.
    Transient exceptions are those that are retryable; non-transient exceptions
    are those that, no matter how many times you retry, will invariantly yield
    the same exceptions.</p>

<p>Examples of transient exceptions are socket closed, lock conflicts, etc.
    Examples of non-transient exceptions are syntax errors.</p>

<h3>Retry Strategies</h3>

<p>Retry strategies are algorithms that govern the behavior related to the
    the application of retry, the amount of time between retries, whether or
    how retry intervals change duration for each subsequent retry, etc.</p>

<p>There are several retry strategies available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>random exponential back-off</li>
    <li>fixed interval</li>
    <li>incremental</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retry Policies</h3>

<p>The framework can be easily extended to support retry for arbitrary use cases,
    such as for database, and communications. Out of the box the framework provides
    two retry policies, a generic retry Policy applicable to communications and
    similar patterns, then a SqlRetryPolicy applicable to JDBC usage scenarios.</p>
